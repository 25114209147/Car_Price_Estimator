# ðŸš— Car Price Prediction
## ðŸ“„ Project Overview
This project leverages data scraped from a used car sales website (mudah.com) to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting car prices. We created a simple user interface (UI) to demonstrate the model, which allows users to input car specifications and get an estimated price. 

## ðŸŽ¯ Features
Price Prediction: Predicts car prices based on key features like make, model, year, mileage, and condition.
User-Friendly Interface: A basic web UI built with Flask to allow users to easily interact with the model.
Customizable: The model can be further trained and adapted to include more features or additional data for improved accuracy.

## How To Run 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask run 
```
Navigate to 127.0.0.1:5000 to access the website.
